As a customer,
so I can watch movies,
I want to book tickets at the local cinema.

As a customer,
so I can receive my tickets,
I want them emailed to me.

As a manager,
so I can understand customer behavior,
I want to keep a record of customers and tickets.

As a manager,
so I can get new customers,
I want to update which movies we show.

As a manager,
so I can sell more tickets,
I want screens to be able to show multiple movies daily.

As a manager,
so I can show more popular movies,
I want screens to be able to show the same movie again.

As a manager,
so I can expand my business,
I want to be able to increase the amount of screens we have.
